# CV App

This project was to understand how React works and more specifically, how components work. In this project I learned how to create components and have them interact with eachother. I learned how to use 'props' to send data to a component and use that data to display info on the cv. I also learned to use a front-end library to design inputs and buttons. I had fun implementing these to make the page look a little nicer. 

## My Process

At first I successfully got everything to work, however, I conducted everything under 'App.jsx'. Essentially, this was just doing vanilla JavaScript on one file. This obviously robbed learning opportunities, so, I refactored everything and split it into components which led me to dig deep and understand components and props. Overall, I enjoyed creating this and I learned a ton and look forward to learning more. 

## Bugs

There is a bug where editing data that is already set does not edit it after submitting.
